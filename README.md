# Machine Learning and SHAP Explainability with Random Forest and XGBoost
# Project 9
# Title
Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Introduction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging models like Random Forest and XGBoost, weâ€™ve accurately identified key factors influencing churn and provided actionable insights. The project includes feature selection, model tuning, and explainability through SHAP values, offering a transparent view of how different features impact customer churn. Additionally, the analysis is complemented by visualizations and dashboards created using Python and Tableau, making the insights both powerful and easy to interpret.
