# Title
# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Introduction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging models like Random Forest and XGBoost, weâ€™ve accurately identified key factors influencing churn and provided actionable insights. The project includes feature selection, model tuning, and explainability through SHAP values, offering a transparent view of how different features impact customer churn. Additionally, the analysis is complemented by visualizations and dashboards created using Python and Tableau, making the insights both powerful and easy to interpret.

# Key Features:

# Data Preprocessing:
1. Handled missing values and outliers to ensure clean and reliable data for modeling.
2. Categorical features were encoded using techniques like OneHotEncoder and Label Encoding.
3. Feature selection was performed to identify the most impactful variables, using methods like SelectKBest.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Visualized the distribution of key features using histograms, box plots, and pair plots.
2. Generated a correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.
3. Created dashboards using Tableau to offer an interactive overview of customer demographics and behaviors.

# Modeling and Prediction:
1. Implemented and compared various machine learning models including Random Forest and XGBoost.
2. Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
3. Applied cross-validation to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.

# Model Interpretation:
1. Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret the impact of each feature on model predictions, providing transparency in decision-making.
2. Generated classification reports and confusion matrices to evaluate model performance on precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Analyzed ROC curves and AUC scores to assess the model's ability to distinguish between churned and non-churned customers.

# Cluster Analysis:
1. Performed customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to identify distinct groups based on customer behavior and characteristics.
2. Visualized customer clusters to help in targeted marketing strategies.

# Future Work:
1. Suggested the implementation of a real-time prediction system to monitor and predict customer churn continuously.
2. Recommended integrating additional data sources, such as social media sentiment analysis, for more comprehensive churn prediction.
   
This project demonstrates a thorough approach to predicting telecom customer churn, combining robust data analysis with powerful machine learning models, and offering actionable insights through clear visualizations and interpretative tools.
